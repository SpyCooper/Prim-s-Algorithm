# Prim's Algorithm
This is my implementation of the Prim's algorithm as a project from our class.

This code will goes through and prints out the minimum spanning trees for each of the graphs in the "graphs" folder and output them to a file in the "MSTs" folder.

All of the graph and minimum spanning tree files are set up as such: 
the first line has the number of vertices in the trees, then every line after that is the first vertex, the connected vertex, and the weight of that connection.

# To run the program
To run the code, you can use "make run" in WSL or on a UNIX system. The output of each graph will be put into the "MSTs" folder. The files that are currently in there are the outputs of my most recent run of the program.
